# LaTeX Demo – GLSL Pop-Art Bachelor Thesis

This repository demonstrates my **LaTeX skills** using Overleaf. It contains a structured scientific document based on my Bachelor thesis, including chapters, figures, and bibliography.

## Repository Structure

```bash
glsl-popart-latex/
 ├── main.tex # Main LaTeX file
 ├── images/ # All figures and graphics
 ├── BA_glsl_popart.pdf # Compiled PDF output
 ├── literatur.bib # Bibliography file
```

## Usage

1. Open `main.tex` in **Overleaf**.  
2. Compile using PDFLaTeX.  
3. The compiled PDF (`BA_glsl_popart.pdf`) includes all chapters, figures, and references.

## Skills Demonstrated

- LaTeX document structuring and typesetting  
- Figures and tables inclusion  
- Bibliography management with BibTeX  
- Modular, maintainable document design
